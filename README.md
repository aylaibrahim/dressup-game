# Web Dress-Up game

All assets were drawn by me with Ipad gen9 and Procreate ~ The JavasScript and CSS together allow me to create visibility toggles for each layer, such as skin > hair > top > bottom > shoes.

The game is currently a work in progress, with more outfits and a UI change coming. 

Current To-do list:
1. Add a background, music, more complex/cute design
2. Add a save screenshot function
3. Add more skintones, make-up, eye colors, hairstyles & outfits

## Some outfit examples
